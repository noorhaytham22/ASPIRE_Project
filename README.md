# Developing Artec’s Strategic Planning Information Report

### Executive Summary

The ASPIRE project has been undertaken to guide Artec Corporation through a transformative journey in the ever-changing toy industry. The report is rooted in a comprehensive understanding of Artec's current position and its ambitious five-year vision. Its primary purpose is to provide a roadmap for success, aligning with Artec's long-term goals, which include surpassing industry peers in sales growth, improving cost efficiencies, and fostering innovation and corporate sustainability.
The report employs a mix of quantitative and qualitative methods, including linear regression analysis and k-means clustering to provide data-driven insights. It also involves the creation of new variables to enhance analysis, focusing on critical areas: Sales & Marketing, Manufacturing Operations & Supply Chain, and Customer Care.

### Data Sources

Product Order Data: The primary datasets used for this analysis are the ARTEC_HOW files (ARTEC_HOW-1 to ARTEC_HOW-4), containing detailed product order information such as brand, line, make, and SKU attributes. These files collectively represent multiple extraction points of the company’s order records, providing a comprehensive view of transactional data for validation, comparison, and trend analysis.

Sales Transaction Data: The project also utilizes the ARTEC_SALES datasets (ARTEC_SALES-1 to ARTEC_SALES-10), which capture extensive sales transaction details, including order totals, associated costs, sales representative performance metrics, vendor information, and facility location data. Together, these datasets support in-depth analysis of sales performance, operational efficiency, and market distribution across various regions.
